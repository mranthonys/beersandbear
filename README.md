CodeLou Final project


My final project is called beers and bears. I began with a simple 4 column flexbox layout design that we learned in Treehouse.
I expanded the layout to include a second row of 4 columns and a third Main Content column. The hamburger menu was styled in CSS using :nth-child and animated in JavaScript with OnClick. 

The first row of columns include 4 pictures that are changed by clicking on them. This was done with imgClickAndChange.

The second set of colums are styled individually using :nth-Child. This was done as an added feature to show that I had a better grasp on CSS. 

The media queries make three adjustments. At 1025px the hamburger menu dissapears and only the links are displayed. The first set of columns becomes 4 columsn making two rows of 4 columns. 
at 769 (tablet size) the first set of columns becomes a single row in order to provide a better layout. The hamburger menu dissapears at this size as well. 

On Moble view the hamburger menu is fully functional with the links hidden inside. Everything become a single easy to read column. 

The main content section in the bottom flexbox is an array of objects. In this section I included some skills I have learned that are featured on the project.
